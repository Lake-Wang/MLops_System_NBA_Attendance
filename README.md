# NBA Stadium Attendance Prediction Using Game Intensity Modeling

This project predicts NBA stadium attendance by modeling game intensity and combining it with contextual data like weather. A two-stage PyTorch pipeline first estimates point differential as a proxy for excitement, then predicts attendance to support scheduling, promotion, and dynamic pricing decisions for the NBA.

## üß† Key Features

- **Two-stage modeling pipeline**: Predict game score margin and use it to forecast attendance.
- **Data integration**: Combines box score, weather, and game metadata from 2022‚Äì2025 seasons.
- **Model serving**: FastAPI-based inference with ONNX optimization.
- **Online evaluation**: Data drift detection and synthetic data testing for real-time robustness.

## üèÄ Motivation

NBA game schedules and TV allocations are often fixed and rarely optimized for fan interest. This project introduces an ML-based tool that forecasts attendance using game intensity signals and contextual factors, allowing the NBA to identify underperforming matchups and optimize resource allocation, promotions, and ticket pricing.

## üß™ System Overview

</p>

1. **Model 1**: Predicts point differential using rolling averages of team statistics.
2. **Model 2**: Uses point differential and weather data to predict game attendance.
3. **Serving**: FastAPI endpoint for real-time inference; ONNX conversion for performance.
4. **Evaluation**: MLFlow for offline tracking, Alibi for online data drift detection.

## üì¶ Data Pipeline

- **Data Sources**: 
  - [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) (box score, attendance)
  - [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com) and [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) (temperature, wind, precipitation)
- **Time Range**: 2022‚Äì23 to 2024‚Äì25 regular seasons
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Rolling 5-game averages
  - Season-wise splits to prevent leakage
  - Weather joins by date and location
